Noteful
=======

Noteful is part of the curriculum in Thinkful's "Fundamentals of Web Development with Rails" course. 

I cloned the bulk of the code from a repository provided by the course.

My contribution to this fork of Noteful deals with handling notes which are over 100 characters. 
The original version of the app presents users with the full note (which is overwhelming.) 
Now, I only present them with the first 100 characters. After that, it displays "... (read more)." 
The Thinkful curriculum walked me through adding this, but the implementation is mine.

Once I finish the course, I plan on tweaking the CSS some more to give it an updated, modern look.

If you want to take a look at the current version of Noteful, you can access it here:
