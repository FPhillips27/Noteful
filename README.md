###Overview

Noteful is a webapp I created as part of the curriculum in Thinkful's "Fundamentals of Web Development with Rails" course (https://www.thinkful.com/courses/learn-ruby-on-rails-online/). 

I cloned the bulk of the code from a repository provided by the course (https://github.com/Thinkful-Ed/Noteful).

My primary contribution to this fork of Noteful deals with handling notes which are over 100 characters. 
The original version of the app presents users with the full note (which is a little overwhelming if you've got multiple notes.) 
Now, I only present them with the first 100 characters. After that, it displays "... (read more)." 
The Thinkful curriculum walked me through adding this, but the implementation is mine.

###Visual Styling
I have tweaked the CSS to make it look a little more stylish.
